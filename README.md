# SquidBots
Welcome to the SquidBots documentation! SquidBots is a plug-in for Offworld games, distributed with Squad and the Squad Editor. Anyone can add to this documentation (just make a pull request).

## History

SquidBots started off as a tool for making Squad videos. The existing workflow of pre-recording your Squad character in PIE and saving out the animation was too time consuming, so I set out to automate some of the processes. The systems created let you entirely keyframe a soldier:

These allowed for the creation of videos like:

The systems became extensive enough that I started messing around with having systems to automaticallly keyframe soldiers: The first test of which was the [Squad Tower Defence mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845442529). Next, I experimented with using behaviour trees and pathfinding to make complex solider AI. The final hurdle was redesigning the system to be replicated (supporting multiplayer), and with those hurdles completed came the first release of the [SquidBots mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891780963). SquidBots is designed to be somewhat game-agnostic, and had been ported with ease to [Post Scriptum (now Squad44)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909251852).

SquidBots was acquired by Offworld, and has now been integrated into Squad's base game.

# General Usage

SquidBots is designed to work in networked games (client), and offline (standalone). When testing in editor, it is recommended to play in standalone.

## Editor Hanging?

There is currently a bug in the SquadEditor that fully automatic sounds can lock up your editor forever without crashing. If you have no need for authentic full auto sounds, it is recommended you disable `Can Use Full Auto Sounds in Editor` in the Editor Preferences. This will replace full auto sounds with semi auto sounds.

## Performance

SquidBots has not yet been optimised for performance. It’s almost all written in Blueprint, and the origins of the mod comes from wanting a high fidelity animation system for cinematics \- the bots are doing lots of potentially unnecessary stuff for general gameplay. The current limitation to bot counts is client performance, and I’d recommend avoiding more than 70 bots existing on a client for now. On a server, the limits are a bit higher, somewhere between 100-200.

When playing in a real game, with a client connected to a server, SquidBots benefits from the AI logic being processed by the server, and the animation logic being handled by the clients. But when playing offline, or testing in editor, it’s all having to be processed by one machine, worsening performance.

When playing offline, \~50 bots would give you acceptable performance (50 bots concentrated around the player can feel more full than 100 players scattered around a 8x8km map).

And when testing in editor, there’s lots of engine debug systems running in the background, again slowing down performance. I’d recommend lowering your bot counts in editor to whatever your pc can handle (for one of my PCs, that’s around 20, for another it’s around 40). (If testing seed layers, use [`AdminSetSeedTargetPlayerCount 10`](https://github.com/OffworldIndustries/SquidBots/blob/main/README.md#seeding-bot-counts))

# Navmeshes

## Navmesh Generation

For bots to move around, SquidBots requires the gameplay layer to have a navmesh. Due to an engine bug, the navmesh must be generated in the gameplay layer, not in the Geo Level (which annoyingly means duplicate navmeshes across layers). Hopefully this will be fixed in Squad in the future, were we to add navmeshes to all the vanilla geo levels.

To build a navmesh, drag-and-drop a `NavMeshBoundsVolume` into your world.

![NavMeshBoundsVolume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/092901f9-9a60-4f05-a8d7-353b2ee21e8d)

I believe the `NavMeshBoundsVolume` can be placed in the Geo Level, but then you must manually generate the NavMesh in the gameplay layer.

You can then scale your `NavMeshBoundsVolume` to the size of your playspace.

![NavMeshBounds In World](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8920274b-eaf9-4a01-9f6c-a7414d0911f0)

Bots are currently unaffected by Squad Map boundaries, so make sure to only have this cover the area you want bots to run around in.  
With editor default settings, the navmesh should then be automatically generated. For more manual control of this, you can disable `Update Navigation Automatically` in the editor preferences. To then manually generate the navmesh, type `RebuildNavigation` in the editor console (`~` key).

![UpdateNavigationAutomatically](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/121a5eff-e85d-41ed-9cac-b089e17dda03)

![RebuildNavigation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8591381b-209b-4be7-8e8f-f9984142ea05)

Note that the automated navmesh generation is asynchronous, so doesn’t lock up the editor and can be cancelled, but `RebuildNavigation` is synchronous, locking up the editor and non cancellable.

Once the navmesh has been generated, you can hit P in the editor viewport and the navmesh will be displayed.  

![NavMesh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b2edad6-bf29-4a62-ae20-3e58047b7c88)

If this isn’t being generated, I’d recommend looking into the [Unreal Engine documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/navigation-system-in-unreal-engine) as Squad is using the Engine’s navigation system out of the box.

When generating automatically, it’s advised that you disable the Navmesh Visualizer (hit P again), as generating with the visualizer enabled drastically worsens performance and slows down generation.

## Navmesh Tuning

Squad has project defaults defined for its navmeshes, tuned for the best results on the existing \~25 squad maps. If you want to manually tune these (which I wouldn’t recommend as it’s a rabbit hole), modify the navmesh settings in the generated `RecastNavMesh_Default`.  

![RecastNavMesh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fee79be-e6c5-46d2-9f19-8a4d3a42fcba)

You can also modify these in the Project Settings, but note that these apply globally, and for modders will be wiped whenever the SDK updates.

![NavigationMeshSettings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9a7f1c8-61fd-4d2f-a2b8-a30e60e11bed)

There are WorldSettings related to AI (`Enable AISystem`, `NavigationSystemConfig`), however they are overridden to use Squad’s defaults, unless `Enable Custom Navigation System Config` is enabled. So I would recommend not touching this.

## Troubleshooting Navmeshes

### Your Navmesh isn’t showing up?

Oftentimes you might need to reload your world, or potentially restart your editor. Sometimes your navmesh can be entirely corrupted, so you may need to delete your existing `RecastNavMesh_Default`, then force `RebuildNavigation` again. Sometimes that doesn't even work, so you may need to move your `NavMeshBoundsVolume`, or delete and replace your `NavMeshBoundsVolume`.

### Your Navmesh isn’t generating on the landscape?

Ensure that `Used for Navigation` is enabled on the landscape.

## Team Restriction Zones

Areas of the navmesh can be marked as restricted to a team. Placing a `NavModifierVolume` in the world, or adding a `NavModifier` component to an existing actor, you can use the `Team1RestrictedZone` or `Team2RestrictedZone`. The restriction zones work that only Bots with Team X can use that section of the navmesh for pathing. (Red \= Team 1, Blue \= Team 2). In vanilla Squad, the `Gameplay_RestrictedTeamZone` used for seeding already has this navmodifier, so seeding layers restrict bots from entering the enemy team’s restricted zone.

# Adding bots to Seeding Layers

Once the navmesh is sorted out, getting bots in seeding is very simple. Assuming you have a functional seed layer already, place an `SQSeedingBotSpawner` in the world.

![SQSeedingBotSpawner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9cdfd5-71fa-4f07-956f-eb2441a4adf6)

You’ll want to place one for each team, near their team’s player spawn point. Ensure that they are within the navmesh, otherwise the bots will be immediately killed on spawn due to stuck detection. For seeding, you’ll only need to modify the `TeamNum` setting. Seeding bot spawners rely on the gamemode being set up correctly. If set up incorrectly, there’ll be logs explaining how to amend the layer.

## Seeding Bot Counts

Seed bot counts are determined by the `SeedTargetPlayerCount` (in the `BP_GameStateSquad_Seed`). This is read from the `ServerConfig/CustomOptions.cfg`. Here’s what is explained there:

```
// Target player count for seeding. Bots will be used to fill the server up to this player count.  
// Teams will be balanced so that both teams have an equal number of players+bots.
// With SeedTargetPlayerCount=40, this is what you'll see:
// On an empty-ish server            // On a more full server
// Team 1    3 players    17 bots        // Team 1    16 players    4 bots
// Team 2    5 players    15 bots        // Team 2    18 players    2 bots
// Bots will all be killed (and none will spawn) when the seed match is live.
#SeedTargetPlayerCount=40
```

Note that the `SpawnerMaxBotCount` is unused for `SeedingBotSpawners`, it just uses the `SeedTargetPlayerCount`. This can be set at runtime using `AdminSetSeedTargetPlayerCount X`.

Multiple seeding bot spawners can be placed per team, but the team will still be limited to the (target player count / 2\) number of bots.

# Squad currently only supports Static Navmeshes

This is significant as Squad’s worlds are quite dynamic, with deployables, vehicles and wrecks affecting the game world and blocking once-available paths. The static navmeshes means that bots don’t know how to path around these objects, and will try to walk into them and get stuck. As a short term workaround (and legacy from the mod), bots stuck walking into deployables will automatically passively dig them down, until the deployable is destroyed or the bot is able to get unstuck. This is important to note in the seeding gamemode, as placing the seed bot spawners near fobs / habs can have gameplay consequences, due to the bots potentially getting stuck and digging these down.
